####Snowflake Modelling

Based on a model devised by Ning and Reiter[1], for modelling the growth of snowflakes in three dimensions, we developed a program which behaves similarly to a snowflake growing from a small crystal over time. Our program models the growth of a snowflake crystal in three dimensions, and then displays a heat map corresponding to the amount of ice at different points on a two-dimensional slice of the snowflake. Two parameters can be varied to construct a variety of crystals. One of these parameters corresponds to the temperature, and the other corresponds to the saturation of water in the area. 

In this repository are several figures showing examples of crystals generated by our program.
